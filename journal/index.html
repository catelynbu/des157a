                <p>In <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>, an article written by Salim Ansari, I learned about key points to keep in mind to create intuitive and easy to use forms. I thought Ansari brought up great examples on how to make form designs that are human-centered for best readability and to reduce cognitive overload. Many people do not enjoy filling out forms so some tips from Ansari to ensure users fill them out are reducing the amount of required steps or areas to fill out, keeping elements vertically aligned to cater to how we naturally read up to down, and appropriately using labels to provide context to the users.</p>

                <p>Form feedback was another major point made by Ansari. By creating a screen that confirms or restates the action just made by the user it reassures them that their inputs went through. This overall imrpoves user experience and preventsconfusion on wherter or not their response or action was understood by the program or website.</p>

                <p>One example of a good form design is with Handshake’s profile editing. This form is super simple with labels on top of form fields, a vertical alignment of fields, and has a descriptive button at the end to complete the form.</p>
