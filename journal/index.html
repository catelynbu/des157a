                <h2>imagery & interactions in websites</h2>
                <time datetime="2025-2-08">february 08, 2025</time>

                <p>I read the article <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a> and learned that a method to improve thinking skills is by analyzing complex images without being given any context. This requires an individual to create a claim about a certain image and ponder what is going on in the photograph, why they believe that is, and what else about the image can they find. According to the article, this practice helped people learn how to describe things in detail and defend their claims with evidence. I think this technique is a great way to get better at argument-making and critical thinking.</p>

                <p>A website I found that uses imagery and interactions well is <a href="https://joonassandell.com/">Joonas Sandell’s Portfolio</a>. This website takes interaction to the next level by having multiple different kinds of user interactions like scroll position, hover, and automatic animations. The way this site uses imagery allows the user to control what happens. As a representation of his work and skills, it is certainly effective in achieving a dynamic and memorable experience for the user.</p>

                <p>The only drawback I can see with this portfolio website is that it’s a bit overwhelming. So although the interactions and animations are very impressive, at times it’s a bit too much. It may be a bit confusing to understand what is clickable and too distracting to read the content. With that in mind, it might be better to reduce the amount of user interactions to prevent confusion.</p>

                <h2>modals, overlays, & dialog windows</h2>
                <time datetime="2025-1-29">january 29, 2025</time>

                <p>After reading more about <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a> in an article written by Naema Baskanderi, I learned how to incorporate overlay screens in my designs and why these best practices are important.</p>

                <p>The best times to use a modal are when you want to grab the user’s attention, need user input, want to show additional info in context, and to show independent content. It’s also incredibly important to have multiple methods the user can exit these screens. It is imperative that users can use the escape key to exit modals in addition to having a button or two that says “cancel,” “exit,” or “x.” This way users can always have the ability to move screens and exit with no problem. Another way to prevent confusion is by darkening the background the modal appears on top of. This allows the user to focus on the dialogue box and helps them realize that the previous screen is now hidden and that they must complete or exit the overlay window first.</p>

                <p>For mobile devices, overlay windows are not recommended since they fit awkwardly on the screen and may have issues with usability due to scrolling and visibility.</p>

                <h2>researching form design</h2>
                <time datetime="2025-1-17">january 17, 2025</time>

                <p>In <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" target="_blank">Best practices for form design</a>, an article written by Salim Ansari, I learned about key points to keep in mind to create intuitive and easy to use forms. I thought Ansari brought up great examples on how to make form designs that are human-centered for best readability and to reduce cognitive overload. Many people do not enjoy filling out forms so some tips from Ansari to ensure users fill them out are reducing the amount of required steps or areas to fill out, keeping elements vertically aligned to cater to how we naturally read up to down, and appropriately using labels to provide context to the users.</p>

                <p>Form feedback was another major point made by Ansari. By creating a screen that confirms or restates the action just made by the user it reassures them that their inputs went through. This overall imrpoves user experience and preventsconfusion on wherter or not their response or action was understood by the program or website.</p>

                <p>One example of a good form design is with <a href="https://joinhandshake.com/" target="_blank">Handshake’s</a> profile editing. This form is super simple with labels on top of form fields, a vertical alignment of fields, and has a descriptive button at the end to complete the form.</p>
